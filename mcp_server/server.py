FastMCP server - The Promise Ledger.

The ledger's machine interface: any client (an ADK agent, the web UI, a CI
job) reads and writes the same verified ledger through these tools. Every
tool here is deterministic and LLM-free - promise EXTRACTION (the one Gemini
step) lives in the web app's streaming pipeline, not on this port.
