"""
Curated seed promises for The Promise Ledger demo.

Each entry is a REAL, public, dated product commitment by an AI company, typed
in by hand from the linked source. The `claimed_*` notes record what a human
believes the outcome was - they are NOT trusted by the system. When the seed
runs, the zero-LLM verifier fetches `evidence_url` live and decides the status
itself; if a note turns out wrong, the ledger will say so.

Fields map 1:1 onto agents.promise_schemas.PromiseExtraction (+ evidence_url).
Keep this list conservative and auditable - it is the spine of the demo, and
the whole product's point is that nothing here is fabricated.
