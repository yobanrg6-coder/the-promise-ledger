"""
Point-in-time evidence via the Wayback Machine - NO LLM.

The verifier's hard problem: a promise asks "did this ship BY date D?", but an
official page only ever shows its state *today*. A changelog is a rolling
window; a pricing page shows this week's prices. So "was it true by D" often
cannot be answered from the live page at all.

This module answers it with the Internet Archive: fetch the official page *as
it was captured near D*. The capture timestamp itself is then the dated
evidence - "the official page said X on 2024-06-30" - with no prose-date
parsing and no third party to trust beyond a neutral public archive.

Uses only the availability API (`archive.org/wayback/available`), which is
fast and reliable; it returns the single closest capture to a timestamp.
