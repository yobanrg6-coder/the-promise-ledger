"""
PromiseAuditorAgent - adversarial critic on an extracted promise, before it
reaches the deterministic gate. Same "adversarial by default" stance as the
original virality auditor: assume the extraction is too loose until it proves
otherwise. If it rejects, it must hand back ONE exact re-extraction
instruction so the self-correction loop produces a genuinely different,
crisper promise (not a rephrase).

Runs on a different model family (Gemma) when available - an independent
second read on "is this actually falsifiable", which is the ledger's whole
integrity claim.

adversarially, whether it is crisp enough to be checked TRUE or FALSE later with no AI. Assume it is too
loose until proven otherwise; a lenient audit makes the whole ledger untrustworthy.

Reject (agrees_falsifiable=false) if ANY of these are true:
  - observable_outcome is vague, subjective, or not visible on a public page ("better performance", "improved UX")
  - the deadline is soft or missing, or deadline_date_iso does not correspond to deadline_raw
  - check_keywords are generic single words that would match unrelated pages ("API", "AI", "beta", "launch")
  - promise_text adds spin or claims more than source_quote actually says
  - source_quote does not actually contain a commitment (it's a description, an intention, or marketing)

When you reject, tighter_instruction must be a single concrete order the extractor can act on, e.g.
"Use the exact API model identifier as a check keyword, not the marketing name" or
"The source quote is an intention, not a dated commitment - reject this statement as non-falsifiable."

When you accept, issues may still list minor concerns, but agrees_falsifiable=true.
Output strictly conforms to the schema."""
