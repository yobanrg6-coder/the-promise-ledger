"""
Pydantic schemas for The Promise Ledger.

A "promise" is a public statement by a company that commits to a specific,
observable outcome by a stated or clearly implied deadline. The ledger only
ever accepts FALSIFIABLE promises - ones that can later be checked TRUE or
FALSE against a public source with no LLM in the loop.
